# TheArk On-chain Analytical 

This software is built with love by github user [vortex](https://github.com/vortex-hue) under [Qubic](qubic.org.ng).

This is the beta and very first version of Theark analytics, an onchain tool that tracks Smart Money Holders actions in the market by monitoring what they're buying, when they're buying it and what they're dumping, the beta version is built not to be perfect, but to solve the problem to some levels, and more modifications would be done
